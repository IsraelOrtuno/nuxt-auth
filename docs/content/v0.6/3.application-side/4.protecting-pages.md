# Protecting Pages

`nuxt-auth` offers different approaches to protect pages:
1. Global protection: Protects all pages with manual exceptions
2. Local protection: Protects specific pages
3. Custom middleware: Create your own middleware
4. Guest mode: Only logged out people can view the page, [more here](/nuxt-auth/v0.6/application-side/guest-mode)

Briefly summarized, you can enable global protection (1) in your `nuxt.config.ts`:
```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
   modules: ['@sidebase/nuxt-auth'],
   auth: {
    globalAppMiddleware: true // Boolean or GlobalMiddlewareOptions
   }
})
```

Now *all pages* will require sign-in. Learn how to add excepted pages [below](/nuxt-auth/v0.6/application-side/protecting-pages#disabling-the-global-middleware-locally)

You can also set an object as the `globalAppMiddleware` in which you can futhur customize the behaviour of the global protection. 

```ts
/**
 * Configuration for the global application-side authentication-middleware.
 */
interface GlobalMiddlewareOptions {
  /**
   * Whether to add a global authentication middleware that protects all pages.
   *
   * @example true
   * @default false
   */
  isEnabled: boolean
  /**
   * Whether to enforce authentication if the target-route does not exist. Per default the middleware redirects
   * to Nuxts' default 404 page instead of forcing a sign-in if the target does not exist. This is to avoid a
   * user-experience and developer-experience of having to sign-in only to see a 404 page afterwards.
   *
   * Note: Setting this to `false` this may lead to `vue-router` + node related warnings like: "Error [ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT] ...",
   * this may be related to https://github.com/nuxt/framework/issues/9438.
   *
   * @example false
   * @default true
   */
  allow404WithoutAuth?: boolean
  /**
   * Whether to automatically set the callback url to the page the user tried to visit when the middleware stopped them. This is useful to disable this when using the credentials provider, as it does not allow a `callbackUrl`. Setting this
   * to a string-value will result in that being used as the callbackUrl path. Note: You also need to set the global `addDefaultCallbackUrl` setting to `false` if you want to fully disable this.
   *
   * @example false
   * @example /i-caught-you-but-now-you-are-signed-in
   * @default true
   */
  addDefaultCallbackUrl?: boolean | string
}
```

To enable page-local protection (2), add the following `definePageMeta` directive to a page:
```vue
<!-- file: ~/pages/protected.vue -->
<template>
  <div>I'm protected!</div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({ middleware: 'auth' })
</script>
```

You cannot mix approach (1) and (2). So, if the global middleware is enabled, you cannot additionally add another protection middleware to a specific page.

## Global middleware

To create a global authentication middleware that ensures that your user is authenticated no matter which page they visit, you configure `nuxt-auth` as follows:
```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@sidebase/nuxt-auth'],
  auth: {
    globalAppMiddleware: true
  }
})
```

That's it! Every page of your application will now need authentication for the user to visit it.

### Middleware Options

In order to use these options, you will still have to define the middleware inside of the [`definePageMeta` macro](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/define-page-meta#definepagemeta)

#### `unauthenticatedOnly`

Whether to only allow unauthenticated users to access this page. Authenticated users will be redirected to `/` or the route defined in `navigateAuthenticatedTo`

```vue
<script setup>
definePageMeta({
  middleware: 'auth',
  auth: { unauthenticatedOnly: true }
})
</script>
```

#### `navigateAuthenticatedTo`

Where to redirect authenticated users if `unauthenticatedOnly` is set to true

```vue
<script setup>
definePageMeta({
  middleware: 'auth',
  auth: { unauthenticatedOnly: true, navigateAuthenticatedTo: '/profile' }
})
</script>
```

#### `navigateUnauthenticatedTo`

Where to redirect unauthenticated users if this page is protected

```vue
<script setup>
definePageMeta({
  middleware: 'auth',
  auth: { navigateUnauthenticatedTo: '/signIn' }
})
</script>
```

### Disabling the global middleware locally

To disable the global middleware on a specific page only, you can use the [`definePageMeta` macro](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/define-page-meta#definepagemeta) to turn `auth` off:
```vue
<!-- file: ~/pages/index.vue -->
<template>
  <div>I'm publicly available!</div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({ auth: false })
</script>
```

Note: This only works on `pages/`. It notably does not work inside the `app.vue`.


## Local middleware

To protect specific pages with a middleware, you can use the [`definePageMeta` macro](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/define-page-meta#definepagemeta) to turn `auth` on:
```vue
<!-- file: ~/pages/unprotected.vue -->
<template>
  <div>I'm protected! Only logged in users will see me</div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({ middleware: 'auth' })
</script>
```

Note: You cannot use local protection when you turned on the global middleware by setting `globalAppMiddleware: true` in the `nuxt-auth` configuration. You will get an error along the lines of "Error: Unknown route middleware: 'auth'". This is because the `auth` middleware is then added globally and not available to use as a local, page-specific middleware.

## Custom middleware

You may create your own application-side middleware in order to implement custom, more advanced authentication logic.

::alert{type="warning"}
Creating a custom middleware is an advanced, experimental option and may result in unexpected or undesired behavior if you are not familiar with advanced Nuxt 3 concepts.
::

To implement your custom middleware:
1. Create an application-side middleware that applies either globally or is named (see [the Nuxt docs for more](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/middleware#middleware-directory))
2. Add logic based on `useAuth` to it

When adding the logic, you need to watch out when calling other `async` composable functions. This can lead to `context`-problems in Nuxt, see [the explanation for this here](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/issues/5740#issuecomment-1229197529). In order to avoid these problems, you will need to either:
- use the undocumented `callWithNuxt` utility when `await`ing other composables,
- return an async function where possible instead of `await`ing it to avoid `callWithNuxt`

Following are examples of both kinds of usage:
::code-group
```ts [direct return]
// file: ~/middleware/authentication.global.ts
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to) => {
  const { status, signIn } = useAuth()

  // Return immediately if user is already authenticated
  if (status.value === 'authenticated') {
    return
  }

  /**
   * We cannot directly call and/or return `signIn` here as `signIn` uses async composables under the hood, leading to "nuxt instance undefined errors", see https://github.com/nuxt/framework/issues/5740#issuecomment-1229197529
   *
   * So to avoid calling it, we return it immediately.
   */
  return signIn(undefined, { callbackUrl: to.path }) as ReturnType<typeof navigateTo>
})
```
```ts [callWithNuxt]
// file: ~/middleware/authentication.global.ts
import { callWithNuxt, useNuxtApp } from '#app'

export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to) => {
  // It's important to do this as early as possible
  const nuxtApp = useNuxtApp()

  const { status, signIn } = useAuth()

  // Return immediately if user is already authenticated
  if (status.value === 'authenticated') {
    return
  }

  /**
   * We cannot directly call and/or return `signIn` here as `signIn` uses async composables under the hood, leading to "nuxt instance undefined errors", see https://github.com/nuxt/framework/issues/5740#issuecomment-1229197529
   *
   * So to avoid calling it, we call it via `callWithNuxt`.
   */
  await callWithNuxt(nuxtApp, signIn, [undefined, { callbackUrl: to.path }])
})
```

## Guest Mode

Since v0.5.0 `nuxt-auth` also offers a guest mode. Checkout the [guest mode](/nuxt-auth/v0.6/application-side/guest-mode) documentation.
